# Java Reference Diagramm Plugin

This plugin for IntelliJ IDEA provides a diagram showing a reference graph for methods in java classes.

A future version shall show orphaned groups of methods, thus visiualize [lack of cohesion of methods](http://sonar-jenkins.blogspot.ch/2012/12/what-is-lcom4.html) 
which is probably slighty different from a graph of dependencies.

This plugin is in a early state.

## TODO
- distinguish overloaded methods
- toggle dependency and orphaned groups mode
